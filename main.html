        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h2>Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs)</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015, the United Nations introduced the
          <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> —a set of 17
          global objectives designed to address some of the world's most
          pressing challenges, including poverty, hunger, climate change, and
          inequality. These goals serve as a blueprint for creating a more
          sustainable and just world by 2030, urging governments, businesses,
          and individuals to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these goals, <strong>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</strong> stands out as a
          crucial step toward ensuring that everyone has access to sufficient,
          nutritious food. Despite global advancements, millions of people still
          suffer from hunger, and food waste remains a major obstacle in the
          fight against food insecurity.

      <h1>SDG 2: Zero Hunger – Ending Hunger</h1>
      <p>
        Zero Hunger is one of the 17 goals set by the United Nations as part of
        the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This goal aims to end
        hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote
        sustainable agriculture worldwide. It is essential to ensure that all
        people, especially vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women,
        and the elderly, have access to sufficient and nutritious food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hunger remains one of Africa’s biggest battles—millions go to bed hungry
        every night, while fertile lands remain underutilized. But what if we
        could change that? What if Africa could not only feed itself but also
        become a global food powerhouse? This vision aligns with Sustainable
        Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger, which aims to end hunger,
        ensure food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable
        agriculture. Achieving this goal is not just about filling empty
        stomachs; it's about creating a future where no child suffers from
        malnutrition, farmers thrive, and Africa stands strong against climate
        change challenges
      </p>
      <h2>Why Hunger in Africa is a Big Deal</h2>
      <p>
        Africa has some of the richest natural resources in the world, yet it
        remains one of the most food-insecure continents(WFP, 2023).The reasons?
        A mix of climate change, poor infrastructure, conflicts, and economic
        instability <strong>(World Bank, 2022)</strong>. But the biggest tragedy
        is that hunger isn't just about food—it's about lost potential.
        Malnourished children struggle in school, weakened workers produce less,
        and entire economies suffer.
      </p>
      <h2>How SDG 2 Can Transform Africa</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Feeding Future Generations</h3>
          Proper nutrition means healthier children, stronger immune systems,
          and better cognitive development (UNICEF, 2022). Imagine an Africa
          where no child dies due to malnutrition!
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Empowering Farmers</h3>
          Over 60% of Africans rely on agriculture for survival (FAO, 2021).
          With better seeds, technology, and access to markets, small-scale
          farmers can increase production and break the cycle of poverty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Climate-Resilient Agriculture</h3>
          With droughts and floods becoming more frequent, Africa must embrace
          smart farming techniques—drought-resistant crops, irrigation, and
          sustainable land management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stronger Economies, Fewer Conflicts</h3>
          Food insecurity often leads to violence and mass migration (WFP,
          2023). By ensuring food stability, nations can focus on growth,
          innovation, and peace.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Needs to Be Done?</h2>
      <p>Africa CAN achieve zero hunger, but it takes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Better government policies supporting agriculture</li>
        <li>More investments in food production & technology</li>
        <li>Stronger global partnerships to share knowledge and resources</li>
        <li>Empowering local farmers</li>
        <li>Creating awareness of the negative effects of <a href="./waste.html" id="food-waste">
