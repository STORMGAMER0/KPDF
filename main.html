        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h2>Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs)</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015, the United Nations introduced the
          <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> —a set of 17
          global objectives designed to address some of the world's most
          pressing challenges, including poverty, hunger, climate change, and
          inequality. These goals serve as a blueprint for creating a more
          sustainable and just world by 2030, urging governments, businesses,
          and individuals to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these goals, SDG 2: Zero Hunger stands out as a crucial step
          toward ensuring that everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious
          food. Despite global advancements, millions of people still suffer
          from hunger, and food waste remains a major obstacle in the fight
          against food insecurity.
