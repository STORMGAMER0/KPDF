      <h1>Waste-Less</h1>
      <p>
        SDG 2 focuses on eliminating hunger, improving food security, and
        promoting sustainable agriculture. However, achieving this goal isn’t
        just about increasing food production—it’s also about
        <strong>reducing food waste</strong> and ensuring better distribution.
        Every year, tons of edible food go to waste, yet many communities
        struggle with food shortages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food waste is the discarding of edible food that could have been eaten
        by people or animals. It can happen at the retail and consumer levels,
        or throughout the food supply chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food waste has a negative impact on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
        2, which aims to end hunger and improve food security. Food waste can
        lead to higher food prices, which can make it harder for low-income
        households to buy food. It can also waste resources like water, land,
        and energy.
      </p>
      <h2>How food waste impacts SDG 2</h2>
      <ul>
      
        <li>
          <h3>Food availability</h3>
          Food waste directly reduces the amount of food available in markets
          and households. When large quantities of edible food are discarded, it
          disrupts the food supply chain, leading to shortages. This can drive
          up food prices, making nutritious food less affordable—especially for
          low-income families who are already struggling to access essential
          meals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Food Security</h3>
          Food security means ensuring that everyone has access to sufficient,
          safe, and nutritious food at all times. However, widespread food waste
          undermines this goal by limiting the amount of food that reaches those
          in need. While millions go hungry, massive amounts of edible food are
          wasted daily, highlighting the gap between food availability and
          accessibility. Reducing food waste is a crucial step toward achieving
          food security and fulfilling SDG 2.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Economic Losses</h3>
          Food waste has significant economic consequences at every level of the
          supply chain. Farmers, producers, and retailers suffer financial
          losses when food is discarded due to overproduction, improper storage,
          or strict quality standards. Consumers also lose money when they buy
          food that goes uneaten and spoils. By minimizing food waste,
          individuals and businesses can save money while contributing to a more
          sustainable food system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Resource Waste</h3>
          Food production requires valuable natural resources such as water,
          land, and energy. When food is wasted, all the resources used to grow,
          harvest, transport, and process it are wasted as well. For example,
          wasting a single meal also means wasting the water and energy that
          went into producing it. By reducing food waste, we can conserve these
          resources and create a more efficient and sustainable food system.
